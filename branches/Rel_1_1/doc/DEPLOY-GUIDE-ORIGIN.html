<h2>Shibboleth Origin Deployment Guide</h2>
</center>
<p>Shibboleth Origin Deployment Guide<br>
Shibboleth Version 1.1<br>
July 28, 2003<br>
</p>
<h3>This version of the deploy guide is for Shibboleth v1.1. For documentation 
related to prior versions of Shibboleth, please consult the appropriate branch 
in the Shibboleth CVS.</h3>
<h3>Federations have been abstracted out from the Shibboleth documentation. For 
further information on using Shibboleth in a federation, refer to the federation 
guide.</h3>
<p>Shibboleth v1.1 is stable and secure enough to deploy in production 
scenarios. It is backward compatible with 1.0 in all respects, including 
configuration, but some older commands have been deprecated or replaced.</p>
<p>Features and changes specific to 1.1 are marked with <span class="feature">
[1.1]</span></p>
<h4>Major New Features in 1.0 and 1.1</h4>
<p>This new release contains several improvements and enhancements, including:
</p>
<h5>Federation Support</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Federation and trust support has been substantially extended. Federation 
    structures are now defined. The set of metadata collected and managed by 
    each Federation is more fully defined. The configuration values assigned by 
    a Federation are now identified. </li>
    <li>There is some support for targets to be members of multiple federations; 
    this support will continue to evolve. When a browser user arrives, a target 
    will determine which federation their origin belongs to, and then use the 
    trust fabric associated with that Federation.</li>
    <li>Better support for flexible and bilateral trust agreements. A key 
    specific to an origin site can be used to vallidate its signature.</li>
    <li>This version contains a significantly more mature security 
    implementation, and should meet the security requirements of typical sites.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Origin</h5>
<ol>
    <li>The Attribute Authority has a powerful new attribute resolver. Simple 
    scenarios (using a string attribute stored in ldap) can be accomplished by 
    merely editing a configuration file. Java classes may still be written for 
    more complex evaluations (eg retrieving information from multiple disparate 
    repositories, and computing the SAML attribute using business rules). This 
    should greatly simplify the process of configuring the AA to support 
    additional general attributes.</li>
    <li>A sample resolver file for using standard LDAP person and inetOrgPerson 
    attributes is included. <span class="feature">[1.1]</span></li>
    <li>Support for a runtime-derived per-requester persistent identifier 
    attribute to support anonymous personalization by targets has been added via 
    an attribute plugin. <span class="feature">[1.1]</span></li>
    <li>Specialized sites without privacy needs can configure identity-based 
    handles interoperable with other SAML deployments. <span class="feature">
    [1.1]</span></li>
</ol>
<h5>Target</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Significantly more flexibility in configuring targets is provided to 
    ensure robustness. Failover and redundant configurations are now supported.</li>
    <li>The SHAR may now optionally store its session and attribute cache in a 
    back-end database in addition to the previously available in-memory option.
    <span class="feature">[1.1]</span> </li>
    <li>Federation supplied files (sites.xml and trust.xml) are now refreshed in 
    a much more robust manner. </li>
    <li>The SHAR can be configured to request specific attributes from the 
    Origin. </li>
    <li>The SHAR can use TCP sockets when responding to the Apache module, for 
    specialized deployment behind firewalls. <span class="feature">[1.1]</span>
    </li>
    <li>Attribute acceptance policies have been greatly enhanced, and are now 
    used to configure all aspects of attribute handling by the target, except 
    for requesting specific attributes by sitename. Adding attributes now takes 
    place in one configuration step. <span class="feature">[1.1]</span> </li>
    <li>Support for Apache 1.3 on Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 has been added.
    <span class="feature">[1.1]</span> </li>
    <li>Microsoft IIS web server support has been added via an ISAPI filter and 
    extension. <span class="feature">[1.1]</span> </li>
</ol>
<h5>Miscellaneous</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Origin sites can configure a value to describe the type of 
    authentication mechanism used at the origin site (e.g. password, Kerberos, 
    PKI, etc.). This value is made available on the target side as Shib-Authentication-Method.
    <br>
    </li>
    <li>Various improvements to error handling. Origin sites are now able to 
    supply an &quot;error URL&quot; and contact information to a federation. When a target 
    encounters an error, it can include this information in the error page. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Local time string values are now used in log files. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Internationalization support has been extended.</li>

<h3><a name="1."></a>1. Shibboleth Overview</h3>
<p>Shibboleth is a system designed to exchange attributes across realms for the 
primary purpose of authorization. It provides a secure framework for one 
organization to transmit attributes about a web-browsing individual across 
security domains to another institution. In the primary usage case, when a user 
attempts to access a resource at a remote domain, the user&#39;s own home security 
domain can send certain information about that user to the target site in a 
trusted exchange. These attributes can then be used by the resource to help 
determine whether to grant the user access to the resource. The user may have 
the ability to decide whether to release specific attributes to certain sites by 
specifying personal Attribute Release Policies (ARP&#39;s), effectively preserving 
privacy while still granting access based on trusted information.</p>
<p>When a user first tries to access a resource protected by Shibboleth, they 
are redirected to a service which asks the user to specify the organization from 
which they want to authenticate. If the user has not yet locally authenticated 
to a WebISO service, the user will then be redirected to their home 
institution&#39;s authentication system. After the user authenticates, the 
Shibboleth components at the local institution will generate a temporary 
reference to the user, known as a handle, for the individual and send this to 
the target site. The target site can then use the handle to ask for attributes 
about this individual. Based on these attributes, the target can decide whether 
or not to grant access to the resource. The user may then be allowed to access 
the requested materials.</p>
<p>There are several controls on privacy in Shibboleth, and mechanisms are 
provided to allow users to determine exactly which information about them is 
released. A user&#39;s actual identity isn&#39;t necessary for many access control 
decisions, so privacy often is needlessly compromised. Instead, the resource 
often utilizes other attributes such as faculty member or member of a certain 
class. While these are commonly determined using the identity of the user, 
Shibboleth provides a way to mutually refer to the same principal without 
revealing that principal&#39;s identity. Because the user is initially known to the 
target site only by a randomly generated temporary handle, if sufficient, the 
target site might know no more about the user than that the user is a member of 
the origin organization. This handle should never be used to decide whether or 
not to grant access, and is intended only as a temporary reference for 
requesting attributes.</p>
<h4><a name="1.a."></a>1.a. Origin</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>There are four primary components to the origin side in Shibboleth: the 
    Attribute Authority (AA), the Handle Service (HS), the directory service, 
    and the local sign-on system (SSO). The AA and HS are provided with 
    Shibboleth, and an open-source WebISO solution, Pubcookie, can be obtained 
    from www.pubcookie.org; the directory is provided by the origin site. 
    Shibboleth is able to interface with a directory exporting an LDAP interface 
    containing user attributes, and is designed such that programming interfaces 
    to other repositories should be readily implemented. Shibboleth relies on 
    standard web server mechanisms to trigger local authentication. A .htaccess 
    file can be easily used to trigger either the local WebISO system or the web 
    server&#39;s own Basic Auth mechanism, which will likely utilize an enterprise 
    authentication system, such as Kerberos.</p>
    <p>From the origin site&#39;s point of view, the first contact will be the 
    redirection of a user to the handle service, which will then consult the SSO 
    system to determine whether the user has already been authenticated. If not, 
    then the browser user will be asked to authenticate, and then sent back to 
    the target URL with a handle bundled in an attribute assertion. Next, a 
    request from the Shibboleth Attribute Requester (SHAR) will arrive at the AA 
    which will include the previously mentioned handle. The AA then consults the 
    ARP&#39;s for the directory entry corresponding to the handle, queries the 
    directory for these attributes, and releases to the SHAR all attributes the 
    SHAR is entitled to know about that user.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="1.b."></a>1.b. Target</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>There are three primary components to the target side in Shibboleth: the 
    Shibboleth Indexical Reference Establisher (SHIRE), the Shibboleth Attribute 
    Requester (SHAR), and the resource manager (RM). An implementation of each 
    of these is included in the standard Shibboleth distribution. These 
    components are intended to run on the same web server.</p>
    <p>From the target&#39;s point of view, a browser will hit the RM with a request 
    for a Shibboleth-protected resource. The RM then allows the SHIRE to step 
    in, which will use the WAYF to acquire the name of a handle service to ask 
    about the user. The handle service (HS) will then reply with a SAML 
    authentication assertion containing a handle, which the SHIRE then hands off 
    to the SHAR. The SHAR uses the handle and the supplied address of the 
    corresponding attribute authority (AA) to request all attributes it is 
    allowed to know about the handle. The SHAR performs some basic validation 
    and analysis based on attribute acceptance policies (AAP&#39;s). These 
    attributes are then handed off to the RM, which is responsible for using 
    these attributes to decide whether to grant access.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="1.c."></a>1.c. Where are you from? (WAYF)</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The WAYF service can be either outsourced and operated by a federation or 
    deployed as part of the SHIRE. It is responsible for allowing a user to 
    associate themself with an institution of their specification, then 
    redirecting the user to the known address for the handle service of that 
    institution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="1.d."></a>1.d. Federations</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>A Shibboleth federation provides part of the underlying trust required 
    for function of the Shibboleth architecture. A federation is a group of 
    organizations(universities, corporations, content providers, etc.) who agree 
    to exchange attributes using the SAML/Shibboleth protocols and abide by a 
    common set of policies and practices. In so doing, they must implicitly or 
    explicitly agree to a common set of guidelines. Joining a federation is not 
    explicitly necessary for operation of Shibboleth, but it dramatically 
    expands the number of targets and origins that can interact without defining 
    bilateral agreements between all these parties.</p>
    <p>A federation can be created in a variety of formats and trust models, but 
    must provide a certain set of services to federation members. It needs to 
    supply a registry to process applications to the federation and distribute 
    membership information to the origin and target sites. This must include 
    distribution of the PKI components necessary for trust between origins and 
    targets. There also needs to be a set of agreements and best practices 
    defined by the federation governing the exchange, use, and population of 
    attributes before and after transit, and there should be a way to find 
    information on local authentication and authorization practices for 
    federation members.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="2."></a>2. Planning</h3>
<p>There are several essential elements that must be present in the environment 
to ensure Shibboleth functions well, both political and technical. Shibboleth is 
entirely written in Java on the origin side. These are the recommendations and 
requirements for a successful implementation of a Shibboleth origin.</p>
<h4><a name="2.a."></a>2.a. Requirements</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A common institutional directory service should be operational; 
    Shibboleth comes with LDAP capabilities built in, and the Attribute 
    Authority has a Java API which will allow specification of interfaces with 
    legacy directories. This is discussed further in <a href="#4.d.">section 4.d</a>.</li>
    <li>A method to authenticate browser users must be in place, preferably in 
    the form of an enterprise authentication service. Some form of an SSO or a 
    WebISO service is not explicitly necessary for Shibboleth; however, it is 
    highly recommended. Implementation details of this are discussed in
    <a href="#4.c.">section 4.c</a>.</li>
    <li>Shibboleth is known to work on Linux and Solaris, but should function on 
    any platform that has a Tomcat implementation.</li>
    <li>It is recommended that a web server must be deployed that can host Java 
    servlets and Tomcat, although not explicitly necessary, as Tomcat can still 
    host an origin without it.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2.b."></a>2.b. Join a Federation</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>While it is not necessary for a target or origin to join a federation, 
    doing so greatly facilitates the implementation of multilateral trust 
    relationships. Each federation will have a different application process. 
    When an origin is accepted into a federation, its information is added to 
    the sites file used by the WAYF and target sites.</p>
    <p><b>It may be necessary to join multiple federations depending on the 
    sites with whom you wish to exchange attributes and the terms under which 
    these interactions will take place. An origin site exists within the context 
    of a single federation, while a single target may accept assertions issued 
    by multiple federations if they are all recognized by the SHAR. If an 
    organization wishes to be a member of multiple federations, it must run a 
    separate origin site for each federation, including a separate AA and HS.</b></p>
    <p>Attribute release and acceptance policies, the use and caching of 
    attributes, and definition of commonly traded attributes are examples of 
    specifications a federation may make. For more information on federations, 
    please refer to the Deployer&#39;s Guide to Federations and the Shibboleth v1.0 
    architectural document.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.c."></a>2.c. Security Considerations</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Shibboleth&#39;s protocols and software have been extensively engineered to 
    provide protection against many attacks. However, the most secure protocol 
    can be compromised if it is placed in an insecure environment. To ensure 
    Shibboleth is as secure as possible, there are several recommended security 
    precautions which should be in place at local sites.</p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>SSL use is optional for origin sites. Federation guidelines should 
        be considered when determining whether to implement SSL, and, in 
        general, SSL should be used for interactions with client machines to 
        provide the necessary authentication and encryption to ensure protection 
        from man-in-the-middle attacks. It is strongly suggested that all 
        password traffic or similarly sensitive data should be SSL-protected. 
        Assessment of the risk tradeoff against possible performance degradation 
        should be performed for all applications.</li>
        <li>Many other attacks can be made on the several redirection steps that 
        Shibboleth takes to complete attribute transfer. The best protection 
        against this is safeguarding the WAYF service and ensuring that rogue 
        targets and origins are not used, generally by development of the trust 
        model underneath Shibboleth. Shibboleth also leverages DNS for security, 
        which is not uncommon, but attacks concerning bad domain information 
        should be considered.</li>
        <li>Information regarding origin users is generally provided by the 
        authoritative enterprise directory, and the acceptance of requests from 
        target applications can be carefully restricted to ensure that all 
        requests the SHAR performs are authorized and all information the origin 
        provides is accurate. Proper security measures should also be in place 
        on directory access and population(see
        <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/giia/internet2/ldap-recipe/#AccessControl">
        Access Control</a> in the

        recipe</a> for more information). Use of plaintext passwords is strongly 
        advised against.</li>
        <li>Server platforms should be properly secured, commensurate with the 
        level that would be expected for a campus&#39; other security services, and 
        cookie stores on client machines should be well protected.</li>

<h4><a name="2.d."></a>2.d. Server Certs</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>In the Shibboleth architecture, the SHIRE, SHAR, HS, and AA must all have 
    various client and/or server certificates for use in signing assertions and 
    creating SSL channels. These should be issued by a commonly accepted CA, 
    which may be stipulated by some Federation rules. Different federations may 
    require the use of different CA&#39;s.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.e."></a>2.e. Attribute Release Policies</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Attribute Authority maintains a set of policies called Attribute 
    Release Policies (or ARP&#39;s) that govern the sharing of user attributes with 
    Shibboleth target sites. When a user attempts to access a 
    Shibboleth-protected resource, that resource&#39;s SHAR queries the user&#39;s AA 
    for all attributes to which it is entitled. The SHAR provides its own name 
    and the URL of the resource on behalf of which it is making the request. The 
    AA finds the attributes associated with the browser user, determines an 
    &quot;Effective ARP&quot; for this user, and then sends to the SHAR only the 
    attributes/values allowed in this policy.</p>
    <p>An ARP may be thought of as a sort of filter for outbound attributes; it 
    cannot create attributes or data that aren&#39;t originally present, but it can 
    limit the attributes released and the values those attributes may have when 
    released. It does not change the information in the data sources in any way.</p>
    <p>Each ARP is comprised of one or more rules that specify which attributes 
    and values may be released to a target or set of targets. The assignment of 
    rules to various targets is quite flexible and includes mechanisms for 
    specifying: that a rule should affect all targets (default rule), exact SHAR 
    names for which a rule is applicable, regular expressions against which SHAR 
    names should be matched to determine if a rule is applicable, URL trees for 
    which a rule is applicable.</p>
    <p>For each request, an Effective ARP is determined by locating all ARP&#39;s 
    applicable to the designated user and extracting each rule that matches the 
    querying SHAR and resource. Attributes and values that are specified for 
    release are included in the effective ARP, while those specified for denial 
    are blocked from release. See section <a href="#5.b.i.">5.b.i</a> for 
    details on how ARP&#39;s are processed.</p>
    <p>Various ARP&#39;s may be combined in forming the Effective ARP. For instance, 
    the Site ARP is administratively maintained and applies to all users for 
    which the AA is answerable. User ARP&#39;s apply to a specific user only, and 
    can be maintained either administratively or by the users themselves. All 
    ARP&#39;s are specified using the same syntax and semantics.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.f."></a>2.f. Designate Contacts</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Since Shibboleth deals both with daily technical and operational issues 
    and also with contractual issues, a set of contacts should be set up to 
    support the user base and to facilitate interactions with other Shibboleth 
    sites and federation members. It is recommended that at least technical and 
    administrative contacts be designated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.g."></a>2.g. Browser Requirements</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>A primary Shibboleth design consideration was to require very little or 
    no modification to client machines. The only requirement is that a browser 
    is used which supports cookies, redirection and SSL. Browser users will have 
    to perform an additional click to submit the authentication assertion if 
    JavaScript is not functional.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.h."></a>2.h. Clocks</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/">NTP</a> should be run on all 
    web servers. Shibboleth employs a short handle issuance time to protect 
    against replay attacks. Because of this, any significant degree of clock 
    skew can hinder the ability of users to access sites successfully.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.i."></a>2.i. Other Considerations</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Especially for higher education, there are a handful of laws enacted 
    which may have important ramifications on the disclosure of personal 
    information and attributes. Since Shibboleth does not necessarily need to 
    transmit identity, it is an ideal solution for many higher education 
    situations. Nevertheless, all parties within the United States of America 
    are strongly advised to consult the
    <a href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OM/fpco/ferpa/">Family Educational Rights 
    and Privacy Act of 1974(FERPA)</a>, and all other relevant state and federal 
    legislation before deploying Shibboleth.</p>

    of those two elements ( &lt;!-- and --&gt; ).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
</p>
<h4><a name="4.b."></a>4.b. Key Generation and Certificate Installation</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The SAML messages generated by the HS must be digitally signed. Each HS 
    must be issued a private and public keypair, which is stored in a Java 
    keystore. The current implementation of Shibboleth requires the use of an 
    ordinary file-based keystore. The keytool program is included with the Java 
    development and runtime kits. Access parameters to the keystore will need to 
    be consistent with those specified in <span class="fixedwidth">
    origin.properties</span>.</p>
    <p>A sample keystore is included in the distribution and can be found in
    <span class="fixedwidth">/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/shibboleth/WEB-INF/classes/conf/keystore 
    .jks</span> with a password of <span class="fixedwidth">shibhs</span>. It is 
    intended to serve as an example and not as a production keystore.</p>
    <p>The following commands will generate a new RSA keypair and store it in 
    the <span class="fixedwidth">keystore.jks</span> file, with a keyentry alias 
    of <span class="fixedwidth">hs</span> and new passwords of your choosing:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="fixedwidth">$ cd /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/shibboleth/WEB-INF/classes/conf<br>
        $ keytool -storepasswd -keystore keystore.jks -new &lt;newpassword&gt;<br>
        $ keytool -genkey -keystore keystore.jks -alias hs -keyalg rsa -keysize 
        2048<br>
        </span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You will be prompted for passwords during key generation as needed, to 
    access the keystore and assign the key itself its own password. You will 
    also be prompted for the distinguished name components to associate with the 
    key. This DN will be placed in a self-signed certificate and will be the 
    name that is associated with your HS by Shibboleth. In particular, the first 
    component you enter for Name will be the <span class="fixedwidth">Common 
    Name</span>(when keytool asks for first and last name, common name is 
    intended), which in most cases should be the hostname of the HS system. Note 
    that a specific federation of sites may dictate what type of key algorithm, 
    key size, or validity period is appropriate.</p>
    <p>Once you have a keypair generated, the self-signed certificate must be 
    replaced with a certificate signed by a CA acceptable to the federation you 
    will be joining. Shibboleth is generally able to climb trust chains to reach 
    an intermediate CA&#39;s root CA. Note that the intermediate CA&#39;s signing 
    certificate must still be signed by a root CA recognized by the federation.</p>
    <p>To generate a certificate signing request for a CA, use the following 
    command:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="fixedwidth">$ keytool -certreq -keystore keystore.jks 
        -alias hs -file &lt;csr-file&gt;<br>
        </span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The contents of <span class="fixedwidth">&lt;csr-file&gt;</span> can then be 
    sent to a CA for signing. You will receive a signed certificate in return in 
    a file. To install the new certificate into your keystore, use the following 
    command:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="fixedwidth">$ keytool -import -keystore keystore.jks 
        -alias hs -file &lt;cert-file&gt;</span> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note that if the signing CA&#39;s certificate is not already installed in 
    your keystore as a trusted signer, you may need to download the CA&#39;s root 
    certificate and import it into the keystore file under a different alias, 
    using a command similar to the above.</p>
    <p>For information on sharing certificate/key pairs between Apache and Java 
    keystores see section <a href="#5.c.">5.c.</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="4.c."></a>4.c. Linking the Authentication System to the HS</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The interaction between the HS and the local authentication system is 
    implemented by supplying the HS with the identity of the browser user. Most 
    often, this will mean protecting the HS servlet with some form of local 
    authentication that populates <span class="fixedwidth">REMOTE_USER</span>. 
    Location blocks can be added to <span class="fixedwidth">httpd.conf</span>, 
    associating the appropriate authentication mechanism with the URL of the HS 
    servlet. The following example demonstrates association of a very basic

<font color="#5555EE">(optional)</font></h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Shibboleth supports client certificate authentication by utilization 
        of a filter that relies on the web server to do all processing to ensure 
        that the certificate is both valid and appropriate for the application. 
        An example deployment descriptor is included with the Shibboleth 
        distribution at <span class="fixedwidth">$SHIB_HOME/webAppConfig/origin-client-cert.xml</span>. 
        To enable the filter, add the following to the deployment descriptor (<span class="fixedwidth">web.xml</span>):</p>

        <p>By default, the filter pulls the principal name out of the
        <span class="fixedwidth">CN</span> of the cert&#39;s
        <span class="fixedwidth">Subject</span> by using regular expression 
        grouping. This may be done using patterns such as:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><span class="fixedwidth">regex: &#39;.*CN=([^,/]+).*&#39; match group: 1</span>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The servlet filter will accept two initialization parameters,
        <span class="fixedwidth">regex</span> and <span class="fixedwidth">
        matchGroup</span> that can be used to extract the principal name

<h4><a name="4.d."></a>4.d. Establishing default ARP&#39;s for the origin community</h4>
<p><b>For a more basic introduction to ARP&#39;s, please refer to section
<a href="#2.e.">2.e</a>.</b></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>An ARP determines which attributes are released to a SHAR when a user 
    tries to access a resource. It acts as a sort of filter on user information 
    contained in the authoritative directory, deciding what can be released to 
    whom, but not modifying or creating information itself. ARP&#39;s are generally 
    administered by the site, but Shibboleth will provide for users to broker 
    control of their own information and privacy by allowing them to create 
    ARP&#39;s pertaining to themselves.</p>
    <p>It is recommended that a set of policies be established between an origin 
    and frequently accessed targets to specify default releases of expected 
    attributes. Federation guidelines may provide more information on population 
    of ARP&#39;s.</p>
    <p>Currently, there is no direct mechanism for users to create their own 
    ARP&#39;s besides direct XML writing. In future versions, a GUI will be provided 
    for simpler management of ARP&#39;s. Care should be given to balancing giving 
    sufficient control over information to users and avoiding access problems. 
    For example, users may decide to restrict the release of their personal 
    information to such a degree that access to a site for a class may become 
    impossible because Shibboleth cannot release enough information to grant 
    access.</p>
    <p>The Shibboleth distribution contains an example site arp that releases 
    the eduPersonScopedAffiliation attribute to all targets. For more precise 
    information regarding how ARP&#39;s are processed or syntactically formed, 
    please refer to section <a href="#5.b.i.">5.b.i</a>.</p>

    <p>Every ARP file contains one ARP. ARP&#39;s may be specified either as the 
    site ARP or user ARP&#39;s. The site ARP pertains to every principal for whom 
    the AA retrieves information; a user ARP applies only to the individual user 
    for whom it is defined. The set of principals to whom the ARP applies is 
    defined by the name of the ARP file: the site ARP is stored in
    <span class="fixedwidth">arp.site.xml</span> and user ARP&#39;s are stored as
    <span class="fixedwidth">arp.user.$PRINCIPALNAME.xml</span>. Up to two ARP&#39;s 
    will apply to a principal: the site ARP, and the user ARP for that 
    principal.</p>
    <p>Each ARP acts as a container that holds a set of ARP rules that are 
    applicable to the principals that ARP is effective for. Each ARP rule 
    specifies a single release policy within the ARP container pertaining to a 
    specific set of targets. This set of targets may be specified as a specific 
    SHAR, a SHAR tree, or a regular expression, and becomes the ARP rule&#39;s 
    target definition. Each ARP rule may contain specifications regarding the 
    release of any number of attribute values to requests matching that ARP rule 
    for that user. ARP rules may be flagged as default, implying that they are 
    always applied to any user matched by the ARP container. Note that ARP&#39;s may 
    also be used to restrict specific attribute/value pairs in addition to 
    restricting or releasing individual attributes.</p>
    <p>When a query is received, the AA generates an effective ARP, which is the 
    fully evaluated set of ARP rules regarding that SHAR based on all ARP 
    containers applicable to the principal. This effective ARP is then applied 
    to attribute values retrieved from the directory and the appropriate 
    assertion is constructed. Default rules are always included in construction 
    of the effective ARP.</p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When a request arrives from a particular SHAR, the applicable set of 
        ARP rules are parsed into an effective ARP. This parsing is done as 
        follows:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Identify all ARP&#39;s that should be applied to a particular 
            principal. This is done by isolating the files in the folder 
            specified by <span class="fixedwidth">
            edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.aa.arp.provider.FileSystemArpRepository.Path</span> 
            that have the name either arp.site.xml or 
            arp.user.$PRINCIPALNAME.xml.</li>
            <li>Find all ARP rules relevant to the query:
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Any ARP rules within the identified ARP&#39;s designated as 
                defaults are automatically included in the effective ARP without 
                performing any matching functions.</li>
                <li>For each non-default rule in each identified ARP, the 
                matching functions specified in the rule&#39;s target definition are 
                performed. A separate matching function is performed for the 
                requesting SHAR and the resource on behalf of which the SHAR is 
                making the request.</li>
                <li>Each matching function evaluates to <span class="fixedwidth">
                TRUE</span> if the match is successful or
                <span class="fixedwidth">FALSE</span> if it is unsuccessful. If 
                both functions evaluate to <span class="fixedwidth">TRUE</span>, 
                the rule is included in the Effective ARP.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Construct the Attribute Filter:
            <ol type="i">
                <li>For each attribute, compile a temporary list of associated 
                rules that includes all values with a release qualifier of
                <span class="fixedwidth">permit</span>.</li>
                <li>Subtract from this list all attribute values with rules 
                specifying a release qualifier of <span class="fixedwidth">deny</span>. 
                The resulting list represents the allowable release values for 
                the attribute and is used as a mask for the values which are 
                returned from the Attribute Resolver.</li>
                <li>If a statement specifies that all values should be 
                permitted, then specific <span class="fixedwidth">deny</span> 
                qualifiers for specific values should still be enforced. If a 
                statement specifies that all values should be denied, then
                <span class="fixedwidth">permit</span> qualifiers for specific 
                values will be ignored.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Using the mask and attributes returned from the Attribute 
            Resolver, an assertion is constructed.</li>

        <span class="fixedwidth">AttributeReleasePolicy</span> element 
        referencing the appropriate <span class="fixedwidth">xsi:schemaLocation</span> 
        and a self-explanatory <span class="fixedwidth">Description</span> 
        element followed by any number of <span class="fixedwidth">Rule</span> 
        elements. Each <span class="fixedwidth">Rule</span> element must consist

        <span class="fixedwidth">Attribute</span> elements. The

        attributes that may be released.</p>
        <p>The simplest possible ARP is as follows, which releases

    <p>All ARP&#39;s must take the same basic form. A detailed description of how 
    each element of the <span class="fixedwidth">Rule</span> element may be 
    sub-populated follows:</p>

<h4><a name="5.d."></a>5.d. The Attribute Resolver</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Shibboleth provides a powerful attribute resolver that allows origins to 
    quickly configure the retrieval of simple attributes from standard types of 
    attribute stores. The resolver is configured using an xml file wich should 
    be pointed to with the <span class="fixedwidth">
    edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.aa. 
    attrresolv.AttributeResolver.ResolverConfig</span> propety in
    <span class="fixedwidth">origin.properties</span> as described in section
    <a href="#4.a.">4.a</a>. For more complex attributes or those that require 
    processing before release, customized Java classes will need to be written. 
    For more information, consult the programmer&#39;s guide.</p>
    <p>The resolver is essentially a directed graph from attribute definitions 
    to data connectors. The data connectors pull data, in the form of 
    attributes, from external data sources. The attribute definitions then 
    process this data into a from suitable for use by Shibboleth. This procedure 
    can be as simple as taking an unmodified string value from a data connector 
    and tagging it with a name or can include arbitrarily complex business 
    rules.</p>
    <p>The <span class="fixedwidth">resolver.xml</span> file that is pointed to 
    by <span class="fixedwidth">origin.properties</span> consists of zero or 
    more attribute definitions followed by zero or more data connectors. Each 
    attribute definition consists of an identifier corresponding to the URN of 
    the attribute, and optional references to data connectors on which it 
    depends. Each data connector consists of a string identifier which is used 
    by attribute definitions that refer to it, and one or more elements specific 
    to the configuration of that data connector.</p>
    <p>Shibboleth comes with two attribute definitions provided in version 1.1: 
    the <span class="fixedwidth">SimpleAttributeDefinition</span>, which acts as 
    a basic proxy for attributes supplied by data connectors with some name 
    conversion and attribute scoping added, and a <span class="fixedwidth">
    CustomAttributeDefinition</span>, which can be used to configure 
    user-created attribute definition plugins. Similarly, Shibboleth 1.1 comes 
    with two data connectors: the <span class="fixedwidth">
    JNDIDirectoryDataConnector</span>, which pulls data from any source for 
    which there is a JNDI Directory Context implementation, including LDAP, NDS, 
    etc., and the <span class="fixedwidth">CustomDataConnector</span>, which is 
    used to configure user-created data connector plugins.</p>
    <p>A detailed explanation of each configuration option for the provided 
    connectors follows:</p>
    <p><span class="fixedwidth">JNDIDirectoryDataConnector</span>:</p>
    <dl>
        <dd class="attribute"><span class="fixedwidth">id = &lt;string&gt;</span> </dd>

        <dd class="attribute"><span class="fixedwidth">&lt;Property name=&quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot; 
        value=&quot;&lt;value&gt;&quot;/&gt;</span> </dd>
        <dd class="value">An element of the element <span class="fixedwidth">
        JNDIDirectoryDataConnector</span>. Specifies a set of name/value pairs 
        that are used to configure the JNDI Directory Context. This list of 
        name/value pairs is defined by the context itself, but is specified 
        within <span class="fixedwidth">resolver.xml</span>. Refer to the

    <p>If the ldap server must be accessed over SSL, and JDK 1.4.1 is being used, two changes must be made to the <span class="fixedwidth">JNDIDirectoryDataConnector</span> element:</p>

<h4><a name="5.d.i."></a>5.d.i <span class="fixedwidth">resolvertest</span></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Shibboleth comes bundled with the command line utility
    <span class="fixedwidth">resolvertest</span> for testing Attribute Resolver 
    configurations. This program takes as input <span class="fixedwidth">
    resolver.xml</span>, the name of a user, and optionally the name of a 
    requesting SHAR. It outputs the resulting SAML &lt;Attribute /&gt; elements. This 
    allows administrators to view the results of tweaking the resolver 
    configuration without having to continually reload the origin web 
    application. <span class="fixedwidth">resolvertest</span> is also useful for testing when the AA  is first configured to use an attribute repository (ldap or sql). Initially, the following two steps must be performed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set the shell variable <span class="fixedwidth">SHIB_HOME</span> to 
        the directory path where the Shibboleth tarball was exploded (typically
        <span class="fixedwidth">/opt/shibboleth-origin-1.1/</span>).</li>
        <li>Move to $SHIB_HOME/bin</li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="fixedwidth">resolvertest</span> may then be used by 
    executing the shell script, passing the name of a user and a URL to the 
    Attribute Resolver configuration file as parameters. For example:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="fixedwidth">$ ./resolvertest --user=wassa 
        --file=file:///$SHIB_HOME/src/conf/resolver.xml</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5>NOTE: This program does not filter the resulting attributes through the 
    applicable ARP&#39;s. Although it does show the attributes generated by the 
    resolver for a particular user or URL, it does not necessarily reflect what 
    will be released by the AA to a requesting SHAR.</h5>

<h4><a name="5.e."></a>5.e. Local Error Page</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Origin sites are encouraged to provide federations with the URL of a 
    local Shibboleth error page. If a browser user from the origin site 
    encounters a problem at a shibbolized target, the target is likely to 
    display an error page that includes a link back to this origin provided 
    page.</p>
    <p>The page should provide information on how to obtain local support for 
    using Shibbolized resources. It might also include suggestions on what 
    information should be recorded before beginning the problem resolution 
    process.</p>

<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="5.f."></a>5.f. Using a New Attribute</h4>
<p>In order for an attribute to be sent to a target, two steps are required:</p>
<p>1. The attribute has to be defined in resolver.xml. See section <a href="#5.d.">5.d</a>.</p>
<p>2. The effective ARP for that target has to release this attribute value. See section <a href="#5.b.">5.b.</a>.</p>
<p>Note: resolvertest is a useful tool for verifying the correctness of the definitions.</p>
<p>Note: the AAP at the target must also define this attribute. See the Shibboleth Target Deploy Guide.</p>

<h3><a name="6."></a>6. Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>This section provides basic information about testing, logging, and error 
handling for Shibboleth origins. This information is not intended to be 
comprehensive, but instead rudimentary guidelines for basic configuration tests 
and problems. For more detailed information or answers to specific problems not 
addressed in this section, please mail
<a href="mailto:mace-shib-users@internet2.edu">mace-shib-users@internet2.edu</a> 
with a thorough description of errors and configurations used.</p>
<h4><a name="6.a."></a>6.a. Basic Testing</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Internet2 provides a basic target that can be used to test origin setup 
    functionality. After your origin is recognized by InQueue, simply use any 
    browser to access <a href="https://wayf.internet2.edu/InQueue/sample.jsp">
    https://wayf.internet2.edu/InQueue/sample.jsp</a>. Select your origin&#39;s name 
    and follow the login process as a user would. Note that SSL must be used, 
    and both the HS and AA must be fully configured.</p>
    <p>The test target will then display a simple page which includes the basic 
    information sent to it by your origin and the authentication rules it is 
    using.</p>
    <p><b>For information regarding specific error messages that may be 
    generated if the origin does not work successfully, please refer to section
    <a href="#6.c.">6.c</a>.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="6.b."></a>6.b. Logging</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Shibboleth&#39;s origin components log various operations which may prove 
    useful for auditing, testing, and security purposes. This data is sent 
    through <span class="fixedwidth">log4j</span>&#39;s standard mechanism. The 
    location of the log file, the level at which the log is output, the 
    formatting of the logs, and many more options may be configured by editing
    <span class="fixedwidth">/WEB-INF/classes/conf/log4j.properties</span>. By 
    default, it is setup to log to the console of the servlet container, with a 
    level of <span class="fixedwidth">WARN</span>, but there is also a commented 
    out example in the file to give a possible alternate configuration.</p>
