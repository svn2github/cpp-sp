   	Keys and certificates are resolved using Credential Resolvers. Two types are
   	currently defined, file-based keys and certs and for Java implementations,
   	keystore-based keys and certs.
   	
   	All resolvers must contain a unique XML Id attribute.
   	
    File resolvers currently support DER, PEM, and PKCS12 formats. PEM files can contain
    keys and certs and cert chains in a single file.
