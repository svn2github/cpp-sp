# You can now do most of this in shibboleth.xml using the RequestMap
# but you MUST enable AuthType shibboleth for the module to process
# any requests, and there MUST be a require command as well.
# You can even turn on require valid-user at the root, and then override
# as needed. This will not actually force a user session unless
# you tell it to require one. See the documentation for details.
